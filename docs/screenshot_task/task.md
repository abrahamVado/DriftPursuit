# Screenshot Capture Task

## Objective
- Document up-to-date visual references for the prototype covering gameplay, the cave map, and available vehicle loadouts.

## Steps
1. Launch the full stack via Docker Compose to ensure consistent environments.
2. Enter a match session with at least one human-controlled client and optional bots for activity.
3. Capture three high-resolution screenshots:
   - Gameplay moment showcasing HUD elements and active combat.
   - Map overview illustrating cave topology and chunk streaming.
   - Vehicle selection or hangar view displaying current loadouts.
4. Store screenshots under `docs/media/` with descriptive filenames and update asset metadata if applicable.
5. Verify screenshots reflect the latest UI/UX before distributing to documentation or marketing channels.

## Deliverables
- Three PNG screenshots saved in `docs/media/`.
- Update notes summarizing capture context (date, build hash) for traceability.
