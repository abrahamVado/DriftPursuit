# Mars Cave Immersion Task Breakdown

- [x] Expand the subterranean chunk streaming window so the surrounding cave geometry remains visible as the skiff travels through the tunnels.
- [x] Remap the flight controls to aviation-style bindings (Arrow Up/Down throttle, Q/E yaw, A/B roll, W/S pitch) for better spatial orientation inside the cave.
- [x] Align the third-person chase camera and lighting with the vehicle's motion so the player feels embedded in the cave environment.

These tasks support the request to make the cave traversal readable and immersive while piloting the Mars surveyor.
